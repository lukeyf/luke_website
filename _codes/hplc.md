This is a data science project that performs auto-peak-recognition and integration to make decisions during chemical reactions. The project is part of the central algorithm from [this publication](https://chemistry-europe.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/cmtd.202200009). The explanation of the peak recognition algorithm can be found [here](http://lukeyf.github.io/files/hydra_si.pdf) and the code can be found [here](https://gitlab.com/heingroup/hydra/-/tree/main/experiments/utilities/hplc_analysis_tools).
