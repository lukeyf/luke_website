This is a personal interest project that uses `mirai` and `nonebot` to create a customized chatting bot for the social media software Tencent QQ. The bot is connected using `gocqhttp` and is integrated with the current `ChatGPT` chatting service. The repository can be found [here](https://github.com/lukeyf/koe_bot).
